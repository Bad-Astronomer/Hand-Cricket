# Hand-Cricket
Just a simple game website inspired by the kids game "Hand Cricket"!  

## Rules:  
Players are allowed to input 1-6 during a small window of time.  
This input is then chosen after the window expires.  
The bot also randomly chooses a number.  
If both the player and the bot choose the same number, it's a wicket.  
If no input is entered during the time span, it's considered a dot/ dead ball.   
3 Consecutive dot balls while batting will result in the loss of a wicket.  

## Optional/ Planned Updates:  
The time given to think decreases each over.  
The bot will learn and pick the inputs that were chosen most often.  
A toss at the start of the match to decide the inning.  
Support for Multi-player.
